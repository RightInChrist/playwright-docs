# Copyright Component Documentation

## Purpose and Responsibilities
The `copyright.js` component in the "playwright" project serves the purpose of including the copyright notice and license information for the project. It ensures that the appropriate legal information is included in the project's source code files.

The main responsibilities of this component are:
1. Displaying the copyright notice, attributing ownership to Microsoft Corporation.
2. Specifying the license under which the project is distributed, which is the Apache License, Version 2.0.
3. Providing information on how to obtain a copy of the license.
4. Clarifying the terms and conditions of the license, such as the lack of warranties and the limitations of liability.

## Key Classes, Functions, or Methods
The `copyright.js` component does not contain any classes, functions, or methods. It consists solely of a multi-line comment that includes the copyright notice and license information.

## Dependencies and Relationships
The `copyright.js` component does not have any direct dependencies on other components within the "playwright" project. It is a standalone file that can be included in other source code files to provide the necessary legal information.

However, it is important to note that the `copyright.js` component is typically included at the beginning of other source code files in the project. This ensures that the copyright notice and license information are prominently displayed and easily accessible.

## Mermaid Class or Component Diagram
As the `copyright.js` component does not contain any classes or have any relationships with other components, there is no relevant class or component diagram to represent its structure.

## Usage Examples
To use the `copyright.js` component, simply include the entire comment block at the beginning of a source code file in the "playwright" project. Here's an example:

```javascript
/**
 * Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
 *
 * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
 * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
 * You may obtain a copy of the License at

 * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

 * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software

 * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
 * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
 * limitations under the License.
 */

// Rest of the source code...
```

By including this comment block, the source code file will have the necessary copyright and license information.

## Important Implementation Details
When using the `copyright.js` component, keep the following implementation details in mind:

1. The copyright notice should be attributed to Microsoft Corporation, as they are the owners of the "playwright" project.
2. The license used is the Apache License, Version 2.0. Make sure to include the correct license URL (`http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0`) in the comment block.
3. The comment block should be placed at the beginning of each source code file to ensure visibility and compliance with the license terms.
4. Do not modify the content of the `copyright.js` component unless there are updates to the copyright information or license terms.

By following these implementation details, you can ensure that the "playwright" project adheres to the necessary legal requirements and properly attributes the copyright and license information.
