# Playwright Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) browser automation framework, generated using an AI-powered documentation generation tool based on Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

## Overview

Playwright is a powerful browser automation framework developed by Microsoft that enables reliable end-to-end testing and automation across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. Built with a focus on modern web testing needs, Playwright provides a unified API that works consistently across browsers while offering advanced capabilities like auto-waiting, network interception, and mobile emulation.

## How This Documentation Was Generated

This documentation was generated using an AI-powered documentation workflow that:

1. Explores the Playwright codebase structure
2. Identifies key components and their relationships
3. Generates detailed documentation with Mermaid diagrams
4. Creates a comprehensive index and relationship maps

The documentation generation tool uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic to analyze code and generate human-quality technical documentation.
