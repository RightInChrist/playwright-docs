# Playwright Documentation

## Executive Summary

Playwright is a powerful browser automation framework developed by Microsoft that enables reliable end-to-end testing and automation across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. Built with a focus on modern web testing needs, Playwright provides a unified API that works consistently across browsers while offering advanced capabilities like auto-waiting, network interception, and mobile emulation.

The project is structured as a monorepo with several key packages:
- **playwright-core**: The foundation that provides browser automation without bundling browsers
- **playwright**: The main package that extends core with browser installations
- **playwright-test**: A complete testing solution with fixtures, parallelization, and reporting
- **Browser-specific packages**: For targeted browser automation
- **Component testing packages**: For testing UI components in isolation

This documentation provides comprehensive information about Playwright's architecture, components, and workflows to help developers effectively use and extend the framework.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install Playwright with the Test Runner
npm init playwright@latest

# Or install Playwright library only
npm install playwright
```

### Basic Usage Example

```javascript
// Example: Basic test with Playwright Test
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to a website
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  
  // Interact with the page
  await page.click('text=Get Started');
  
  // Assert something on the page
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
```

### Key Features

1. **Cross-browser automation**: Run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with the same code
2. **Auto-waiting**: Elements are automatically waited for before actions are performed
3. **Network interception**: Monitor and modify network requests and responses
4. **Mobile emulation**: Test responsive designs with device emulation
5. **Powerful selectors**: Locate elements using CSS, XPath, text content, and more
6. **Tracing**: Capture execution traces for debugging and analysis
7. **Component testing**: Test UI components in isolation
